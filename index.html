				<h2>Every idea üí° starts with a need</h2>
				<p>
					Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I could
					improve my design skills and attract more customers. I wanted to start
					designing some ideas that for a long time I had only on paper and
					stored on my cell phone, I decided to look for some challenge,
					something that makes more sense with what I thought. I saw that many
					designers (especially in dribbble) made a daily user interface, I
					really liked the idea, but the problem was that the result was just
					something nice and did not solve any problem.
